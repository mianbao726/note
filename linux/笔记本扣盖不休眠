Suspend trouble with lid close on Gnome

Code:
su -
cd /etc/systemd/
gedit logind.conf

From here, uncomment the line "HandleLidSwitch=suspend", then change "suspend" to "lock".

I also uncommented the line "LidSwitchIgnoreInhibited=yes", but I don't think it's actually necessary because that is already the default behavior.

It worked as expected on my next boot (didn't try it right after, but I don't suppose it won't work). It doesn't suspend, screen just locks and blanks.


sudo systemctl restart systemd-logind
